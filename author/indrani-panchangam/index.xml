What&amp;rsquo;s different about it is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on social media. It takes behavior data, such as might exist within a company&amp;rsquo;s databases, and is able to say &amp;ldquo;This person is causing this person to do X.&amp;rdquo; This technique is broad and powerful and has many social and business applications. We&amp;rsquo;re also fortunate to have a lot of data from corporations to explore, including over a 100m person dataset on charitable giving, several datasets of video game play, and one on commercial travel. What we need are smart students who can learn the algorithm and help us run it, answering questions of both scholarly and commercial interest. We need horsepower, and we&amp;rsquo;re happy to help train, advise and add students to the many publications we see coming out of this effort.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
