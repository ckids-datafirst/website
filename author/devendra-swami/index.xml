&lt;p>The Kaggle.com competition ecosystem is a rich and active community with a designed Progression System that uses performance medals to rank and differentiate users into tiers. However, winning performance medals in Kaggle is more complex than it appears. Users are bound by the available competitions, characteristics of the competition’s problem statement, the quality of their software submissions, and the quality of other competitors (including collaborators). With these factors, one user’s earned “Gold” medal from one competition may have required more effort and a higher quality solution than another user’s earned “Gold” medal in a different competition. This project has great potential to learn about open competitions in data science. Some example questions are: What features help predict whether a user will win a medal in a competition? How can users be clustered and differentiated from one another using their competition patterns and medal-winning solutions? How quickly (in days) will a user win their next competition medal? What is the probability that a user will assemble a team for a competition? What are features that predict high-performing teams? What features help generate teammate recommendations?&lt;/p>
