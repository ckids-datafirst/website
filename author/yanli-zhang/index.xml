Even though hot desking systems are increasingly common and even starting to feel like a trend these days, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much data to show how such systems can support occupants&amp;rsquo; environmental comfort, work productivity, and psychological stability while they are at work. Therefore, this project focuses on investigating how much the occupants are satisfied with their new workplace platform and how much a hotdesking system affects their work productivity, environmental satisfaction, etc. The project&amp;rsquo;s findings will help design this new desking system in a way that will increase occupants&amp;rsquo; satisfaction with their surroundings and productivity at work without compromising their quality of life in the workplace.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
