&lt;p>Fine-grained epidemiological modeling of the spread of COVID-19 can inform public health policy that accounts for disparities in the risk of exposure, infection, and death across different locations and different demographic groups. In Los Angeles County, disparities in COVID-19 infection rates by neighborhood have been tremendous. Throughout the current large outbreak wave, infection incidence rates in low-income, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods of East LA have consistently been 10-15 times higher than in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods in West LA. Many well-informed hypotheses exist to explain the cause of these disparities in infection, including employment sectors that require leaving homes to work, household density, and behavioral differences across cultures and age groups. But for Los Angeles County, these hypotheses have not been evaluated quantitatively in the context of an epidemic modeling framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on disadvantaged demographic groups in Los Angeles County, we are developing a networked multiple-population epidemic model to investigate how epidemic dynamics and infection outcomes differ across fine-grained neighborhoods. Specifically, we will extend an already-developed stochastic SEIR+ disease model that includes healthcare, death, and vaccination compartments into the networked multiple-population framework, which will model movements, contacts, and infection pathways within and between neighborhoods. A key feature of this modeling framework will be the use of dynamic mobility data, derived from US cell phone data, to inform changes in the daily movements of people within and between neighborhoods. This data will provide the basis of a weighted infection-transmissible contact network between neighborhoods. The SEIR disease model is run on top of this contact network, determining infection dynamics across the neighborhoods. The model will allow obtaining estimates of key epidemic quantities including transmission rates (and the time-varying reproductive number, R(t)) and infection fatality rates for each neighborhood, and identifying the neighborhoods driving epidemic spread (through contacts within and across neighborhoods). Furthermore, hierarchical modeling techniques will be used to obtain estimates of infection and fatality rates for substrata representing combinations of ethnicity/race, age, and sex within each neighborhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CKIDS PROJECT TASKS&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the overarching goal of this project is to develop a multiple-population epidemic model for Los Angeles County (LAC) across a network of connected neighborhoods, it is also necessary to maintain a single-population model for LAC as a whole that estimates the epidemic parameters for this larger spatial level. Such a single-population model has been maintained since May 2020 by the USC Biostatistics COVID modeling team. This model serves two important purposes. First, since May 2020 it has supported the LAC Department of Public Health, which has requested updates on key epidemic predictions on a weekly basis. Second; the parameters estimated from the single population model will serve as prior distributions in the Bayesian parameter estimation framework used in the networked-neighborhood model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first task for the CKIDS student will be to re-implement the parameter estimation framework for the existing LAC-level model, such that parameters are estimated each week and fixed for future estimates forward in time. This can be done either through modification to the existing code and parameter estimation framework, written in R and using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), or through a full reimplementation of the modeling code. The second task will be to maintain the model estimation and website displaying updates through weekly updates using data that comes directly from the LAC Department of Public Health. A third possible task, depending on the interest of the CKIDS student, will be to apply the modeling to California data, and other counties in California (so far it has only been applied to LAC data).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Food environments (the physical spaces where people acquire and consume food) can profoundly impact diet and related diseases. Effective, robust measures of food environment nutritional quality are required by researchers and policymakers investigating their effects on individual dietary behavior and designing targeted public health interventions. The most commonly used indicators of food environment nutritional quality are limited to measuring the binary presence or absence of entire categories of food outlet type, such as ‘fast-food’ outlets, which can range from burger joints to salad chains. There would be great value in a summarizing indicator of restaurant nutritional quality that exists along a continuum, and which can be applied at the scale of large food environments, for example across Los Angeles County, to make distinctions between diverse restaurants within and across categories of food outlets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project will explore the ability to track real-life health and nutrition signals from social media data, focusing on data from Foursquare and Yelp. We will investigate the ability to access menu information from the APIs of these social media platforms, and develop measures to assess the nutritional content of these menus. Multiple aims will be investigated in this project, including scraping data from social media; NLP of menu text, tag, and comment data; developing predictive models of obesity; and more. “Ground truth” data on dietary patterns of LA residents will be available, enabling validation of dietary measures and predictive models built from menu data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will explore the ability to track real-life health and nutrition signals from social media data, focusing on data from Instagram and Foursquare. We will investigate the quality of Instagram posts as a source of data for measurements of dietary patterns and nutrition quality, focusing on spatial, textual, and (&lt;em>new in this semester&lt;/em>) image content of posts linked to food outlets in Los Angeles, as well as nutritional content analysis of menus available online. Multiple aims will be investigated in this project, including: scraping data from social media; NLP of tag, comments, and menu data; image analysis; predictive models and social network analysis; and more. Also new in this semester: “ground truth” data on dietary patterns of LA residents will be available, enabling validation of dietary measures and predictive models built from Instagram posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project will build on the DataFest 2019 project, and will expand the scope to actually access up-to-date data from Instagram, in particular: data with images, the underlying social connections / social network, and of course more timely (which requires data scraping).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will investigate the quality of Instagram textual posts as a source of data for measurements of dietary patterns and nutrition quality, focusing on spatial and textual features of posts linked to food outlets. Using an Instagram dataset of all geo-located posts at food outlets in Los Angeles for 3 months in 2014, this project will investigate whether Instagram posts, despite implicit biases (and to the extent possible, accounting for these biases), can provide a representative health signal, informative of the quality of population nutrition and dietary patterns at a highly-resolved (e.g. census tract level) spatial scale.&lt;/p>
