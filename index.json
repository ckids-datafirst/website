Due to the development of generative AI, we might produce synthetic images to enhance the quality of dataset by filling up missing images with them. Based on our prior work in object detection and classification for smart city applications, we would like to explore the potential of AI generated images for an enhanced object detection and classification.\r\n","tags":["Fall 2023"],"title":"Utilizing AI Generated Images for Object Detection and Classification","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Deborah Ho","Jooyoung Yoo","Vanshay Gupta","Ikenna Joe-Nweke","Seon Ho Kim"],"categories":["Fall 2022","Ethics/Equity","Journalism","Best Presentation","Ethics/Equity","Journalism"],"content":"Description The PMR (Police Misconduct Registry) is a database of officers who have been terminated or have resigned in lieu of being fired for misconduct.

This project will allow student to learn and acquire expertise in topics that cross quantum information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning.","tags":["Spring 2022"],"title":"Machine Learning Enabled Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Quantum Circuits","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Jeremy Abramson"],"categories":["Spring 2022"],"content":"Description Open-source intelligence (“OSINT”) is a rapidly growing area of cybersecurity.

In Los Angeles County, disparities in COVID-19 infection rates by neighborhood have been tremendous. Throughout the current large outbreak wave, infection incidence rates in low-income, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods of East LA have consistently been 10-15 times higher than in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods in West LA. Many well-informed hypotheses exist to explain the cause of these disparities in infection, including employment sectors that require leaving homes to work, household density, and behavioral differences across cultures and age groups. But for Los Angeles County, these hypotheses have not been evaluated quantitatively in the context of an epidemic modeling framework.\nTo explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on disadvantaged demographic groups in Los Angeles County, we are developing a networked multiple-population epidemic model to investigate how epidemic dynamics and infection outcomes differ across fine-grained neighborhoods. Specifically, we will extend an already-developed stochastic SEIR+ disease model that includes healthcare, death, and vaccination compartments into the networked multiple-population framework, which will model movements, contacts, and infection pathways within and between neighborhoods. A key feature of this modeling framework will be the use of dynamic mobility data, derived from US cell phone data, to inform changes in the daily movements of people within and between neighborhoods. This data will provide the basis of a weighted infection-transmissible contact network between neighborhoods. The SEIR disease model is run on top of this contact network, determining infection dynamics across the neighborhoods. The model will allow obtaining estimates of key epidemic quantities including transmission rates (and the time-varying reproductive number, R(t)) and infection fatality rates for each neighborhood, and identifying the neighborhoods driving epidemic spread (through contacts within and across neighborhoods). Furthermore, hierarchical modeling techniques will be used to obtain estimates of infection and fatality rates for substrata representing combinations of ethnicity/race, age, and sex within each neighborhood.\nCKIDS PROJECT TASKS\nWhile the overarching goal of this project is to develop a multiple-population epidemic model for Los Angeles County (LAC) across a network of connected neighborhoods, it is also necessary to maintain a single-population model for LAC as a whole that estimates the epidemic parameters for this larger spatial level. Such a single-population model has been maintained since May 2020 by the USC Biostatistics COVID modeling team. This model serves two important purposes. First, since May 2020 it has supported the LAC Department of Public Health, which has requested updates on key epidemic predictions on a weekly basis. Second; the parameters estimated from the single population model will serve as prior distributions in the Bayesian parameter estimation framework used in the networked-neighborhood model.\nThe first task for the CKIDS student will be to re-implement the parameter estimation framework for the existing LAC-level model, such that parameters are estimated each week and fixed for future estimates forward in time. This can be done either through modification to the existing code and parameter estimation framework, written in R and using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), or through a full reimplementation of the modeling code. The second task will be to maintain the model estimation and website displaying updates through weekly updates using data that comes directly from the LAC Department of Public Health. A third possible task, depending on the interest of the CKIDS student, will be to apply the modeling to California data, and other counties in California (so far it has only been applied to LAC data).\nStudents Tao Huang\nJianing (Julia) Chen\nAdvisors Abigail Horn Skills Required by the team Computational Simulation R ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"82dce355499ade0a2af8560321508767","permalink":"https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2021-fall/114/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website/projects/2021-fall/114/","section":"projects","summary":"Fine-grained epidemiological modeling of the spread of COVID-19 can inform public health policy that accounts for disparities in the risk of exposure, infection, and death across different locations and different demographic groups.

Without adequate Internet access, households are at a disadvantage in education, jobs, health, and other key dimensions of wellbeing. While local broadband markets are increasingly concentrated, there is also increased interest in exploring the role those small local operators (“microtelcos”) can play in serving in low-income and rural communities.

This project would be published by Annenberg’s Crosstown publishing outlet and would be distributed widely. The project would have immediate practical applications and could inform policy decisions on issues such as where to place parks and green spaces.","tags":["Fall 2020","Best Interdisciplinary Data Science Team"],"title":"Mapping the impacts of climate change across LA County","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Yuchen Zhang","Nai Cih Liou","Haripriya Dharmala","Sakshi Goel","Raveena Kshatriya","Keith Burghardt"],"categories":["Fall 2020","Ethics/Equity","Best Cyberphysical Data Science Team","Ethics/Equity"],"content":"Description While many stories involve the friendly and familiar, scary stories across cultures, from Hamlet to Yotsuya Kaidan to Siren Head involve beings that are almost—but not quite—human.

Come to our information session and hear from faculty mentors about projects that will be part of DataFirst this Fall semester. Then you can decide if you want to sign up to participate.\nWhat is DataFirst? We are excited to announce the 10th CKIDS DataFest event for Fall 2023. It will be such a special event that we are renaming it DataFirst.\nThis event is an opportunity for data science students to learn to work in teams with people who have different skills, to learn about different application domains, and to work on projects that can only be done with creative ideas.\nCKIDS DataFirst is a semester-long event where faculty offer students an opportunity to work on real-world data science projects. Several faculty advisors propose a project, each with some data and goals that should be feasible in a semester. DataFirst kicks off with 1-slide faculty pitches to an audience of potentially interested students. Students submit their preferred projects and are assigned to one of their choices. Each project is assigned 4-5 students that will work as a team through the semester. The faculty advisor commits to meet with the students once a week, and may make available some senior student or postdoc in their group who knows the data well. The students commit to spending 8-10 hours a week on the project. Students participate in a mid-semester presentation to report on their progress, and a final event where they report on results and we give a couple dozen awards.\nThis Fall we will be providing stronger mentoring and guidance to students along the semester. We will also be allocating space for students to work together and to attend tutorials/panels/QA sessions.\nSome DataFirst projects continue for several semesters, and some have led to publications and even helped jumpstart long-lived projects.\nEvery semester we have had 10-20 projects, so that is about 50-100 students participating. The students tend to be Viterbi masters students (some data science, some computer science and some from industrial systems engineering), but some are undergraduates and some students are in other schools as well.\nCome to our information session and hear from faculty mentors about projects that will be part of DataFirst this Fall semester.

A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see “About commits”.\n⌨️ Activity: Your first commit The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.\nOn the \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Code tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you’re on your new branch add-picture-\u0026lt;your-name\u0026gt;.\nNavigate to the folder content/authors/ and click on the folder with your name.\nSelect the Add file drop-down and click Upload a new file. The filename should be avatar.png or avatar.jpeg\nClick Commit changes… in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what’s included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let’s change it slightly for practice.

GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source software. 📺 Video: What is GitHub?\nWhat is a repository?: A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders. For more information, see “About repositories” from GitHub Docs.\nWhat is a branch?: A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.\nBranches allow you to separate your work from the main branch. In other words, everyone’s work is safe while you contribute. For more information, see “About branches”.\n⌨️ Activity: Your first branch Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly made repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.\nNavigate to the \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Code tab in the header menu of your repository.\nClick on the main branch drop-down.\nIn the field, enter a name for your branch: add-picture-\u0026lt;your-name\u0026gt;. For example: add-picture-max\nClick Create branch: add-picture-\u0026lt;your-name\u0026gt; to create your branch.\nThe branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created. The main branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.\nNext, you’ll learn how to commit a file to your new branch.
