&lt;p>The PMR (Police Misconduct Registry) is a database of officers who have been terminated or have resigned in lieu of being fired for misconduct. The objective of PMR is to increase the public trust and legitimacy of law enforcement officers serving the community while also helping departments hire the best possible candidates. The PMR is continually populated with all instances of police misconduct anywhere in the United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, data entries are manually identified, discovered and registered using public, open-sourced information, mostly news articles on the web, which critically limits its data collection process. Thus, this project aims at automating the discovery of such data with an efficient identification mechanism. Working with the Price School of Policy, we will implement an automatic identification mechanism to effectively search police misconduct articles utilizing web crawling/scarping and natural language processing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Novel, or hypothesized medical treatments, such as COVID-19 vaccines and male contraception, are regularly discussed on social media. For example, on the AskReddit subreddit, questions of the form “”Would you take [x] if it existed?”” Aside from willingness to use these novel treatments, the answers to these questions contain important clues to peoples’ latent concerns and barriers to adoption of novel medications. Understanding them can provide crucial information about how to introduce, communicate, and counsel about new medications when they come to market. In this project you will use pre-collected Reddit data spanning 10 years to answer questions including: What concerns do individuals have about a novel medication? How do these concerns vary by demographics, such as cultural background? How have these concerns evolved over time? What has caused users to become more or less accepting of the treatment over time?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Top climate scientists post their findings and views regularly on social media. These very scientists are met with tweets from those with opposing views, often containing vitriolic and false information. It is important that we can identify and characterize these tweets to understand the counter-narratives of climate change. We will address topics including false information, bot campaigns, and harassment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This new project attempts to understand the interaction between anti-vaxxers (anti-vaccination groups) and alt-right groups on platforms such as Facebook. The goal of this project is to understand how do these two types of fringe groups interact over the years, and how do their interactions and discourse evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be interesting to explore the longitudinal patterns of network/discourse co-evolution and how such patterns may change in times of dramatic events.In terms of data, I have access to Facebook’s historical data archive and I have collected a dataset that contains a list of anti-vaxxer (n=158) and alt-right groups’ (n=183) Facebook posts over 10 years (2010-2021). The dataset can be further expanded with additional help.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Common sense knowledge bases are used widely in research, spanning many areas in artificial intelligence, including natural language understanding, computer vision, and planning. However, these resources may contain human biases, which will ultimately be embedded in the resulting AI solution and potentially have negative societal impacts. The extent to which these biases exist is unclear. In this project, you will define several well-motivated biases (location, gender, ethnicity) and measure the extent to which they are represented in ConceptNet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fine-grained epidemiological modeling of the spread of COVID-19 can inform public health policy that accounts for disparities in the risk of exposure, infection, and death across different locations and different demographic groups. In Los Angeles County, disparities in COVID-19 infection rates by neighborhood have been tremendous. Throughout the current large outbreak wave, infection incidence rates in low-income, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods of East LA have consistently been 10-15 times higher than in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods in West LA. Many well-informed hypotheses exist to explain the cause of these disparities in infection, including employment sectors that require leaving homes to work, household density, and behavioral differences across cultures and age groups. But for Los Angeles County, these hypotheses have not been evaluated quantitatively in the context of an epidemic modeling framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explain the disproportionate impact of the virus on disadvantaged demographic groups in Los Angeles County, we are developing a networked multiple-population epidemic model to investigate how epidemic dynamics and infection outcomes differ across fine-grained neighborhoods. Specifically, we will extend an already-developed stochastic SEIR+ disease model that includes healthcare, death, and vaccination compartments into the networked multiple-population framework, which will model movements, contacts, and infection pathways within and between neighborhoods. A key feature of this modeling framework will be the use of dynamic mobility data, derived from US cell phone data, to inform changes in the daily movements of people within and between neighborhoods. This data will provide the basis of a weighted infection-transmissible contact network between neighborhoods. The SEIR disease model is run on top of this contact network, determining infection dynamics across the neighborhoods. The model will allow obtaining estimates of key epidemic quantities including transmission rates (and the time-varying reproductive number, R(t)) and infection fatality rates for each neighborhood, and identifying the neighborhoods driving epidemic spread (through contacts within and across neighborhoods). Furthermore, hierarchical modeling techniques will be used to obtain estimates of infection and fatality rates for substrata representing combinations of ethnicity/race, age, and sex within each neighborhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CKIDS PROJECT TASKS&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the overarching goal of this project is to develop a multiple-population epidemic model for Los Angeles County (LAC) across a network of connected neighborhoods, it is also necessary to maintain a single-population model for LAC as a whole that estimates the epidemic parameters for this larger spatial level. Such a single-population model has been maintained since May 2020 by the USC Biostatistics COVID modeling team. This model serves two important purposes. First, since May 2020 it has supported the LAC Department of Public Health, which has requested updates on key epidemic predictions on a weekly basis. Second; the parameters estimated from the single population model will serve as prior distributions in the Bayesian parameter estimation framework used in the networked-neighborhood model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first task for the CKIDS student will be to re-implement the parameter estimation framework for the existing LAC-level model, such that parameters are estimated each week and fixed for future estimates forward in time. This can be done either through modification to the existing code and parameter estimation framework, written in R and using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), or through a full reimplementation of the modeling code. The second task will be to maintain the model estimation and website displaying updates through weekly updates using data that comes directly from the LAC Department of Public Health. A third possible task, depending on the interest of the CKIDS student, will be to apply the modeling to California data, and other counties in California (so far it has only been applied to LAC data).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the recent enthusiasm about algorithmic fairness and responsible AI, many conferences are encouraging or requiring a broader impact section to assess societal harms and benefits of the AI research being presented. In this project, we will analyze the themes of these sections, with a particular focus on the ethical issues being addressed and acknowledged. We will develop tools and methods to evaluate the harms and benefits of the presented research. The goal is to see how is the community helping AI research to be less harmful but more beneficial for society. For more background on work in this area, please review this workshop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While many stories involve the friendly and familiar, scary stories across cultures, from Hamlet to Yotsuya Kaidan to Siren Head involve beings that are almost—but not quite—human. Can these stories give us insight into the “nearly-human” uncanny valley? Initial results from our group say yes! While some research has explored the uncanny valley for images, the research is limited and previously unexplored in text format. If we can extract human emotions surrounding text descriptions, we can exploit an enormous array of data. Our goal this semester is to analyze our objective definitions of “fear” or “creepiness” in a story and test how the similarity of words to “human” make them more or less creepy. Moreover, we will explore what features of objects make them more or less scary. These findings share a direct relationship to AI and robotics where our goal is always to improve pleasant interactions and affability in human-computer and human-robot interactions. The students will build on initial work to apply NLP methods to these texts and improve upon existing initial results.&lt;/p>

Without adequate Internet access, households are at a disadvantage in education, jobs, health, and other key dimensions of wellbeing. While local broadband markets are increasingly concentrated, there is also increased interest in exploring the role those small local operators (“microtelcos”) can play in serving in low-income and rural communities. These microtelcos range from small wireless cooperatives to mom-and-pop private ISPs to municipal-backed operators. This project seeks to a) map and identify the characteristics of communities where microtelcos are present in CA, and b) to examine whether microtelcos presence affects broadband service quality and adoption by businesses and households in the community. The project will use broadband deployment data collected by the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) and socioeconomic data from the Census Bureau.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“The current fractured media landscape allows individuals to choose confirming over credible information, and information spreads quicker online than interventions like fact-checking. Misinformation can be debiased by identifying gaps in mental representations of the world (mental models) and prompt alerts to be vigilant about assessing information (Lewandowsky et al, 2012).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to develop interventions to make media-balance salient to users to mitigate the spread of misinformation. Social sampling theory describes that our misperceptions of others is explained by the sample of people we encounter (Galesic, Olsson, and Rieskamp, 2012), and we are more likely to link to similar people online (Kossinets &amp;amp; Watts, 2009). Our interventions address limitations in individual views of the media landscape. We aim to attach visualizations of sharing network to news articles in real-time to make these biases explicit.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In collaboration with the Sanitation Department of LA, IMSC has been developing a framework to automatically detect the cleanliness of streets as well as any special objects in need of removal. The framework makes use of machine learning technology trained on images/videos collected by the city and/or taken by citizens. The images taken by mobile cameras (e.g., LA City’s garbage collection trucks and/or citizens’ smartphones using our own MediaQ App) are transferred to the MediaQ server, then these images can be automatically classified based on predefined cleanliness indexes and object types (such as bulky item, illegal dumping). In this project, we will focus on the detection and classification of homeless encampments in LA streets. Recorded images/videos with GPS location data will be processed and the classification results will be displayed on a map to understand the distribution of homeless people in LA, which is essential data to study the homeless issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the requirements for success in the workforce become increasingly technical, there is a commensurate need for curricula that can engage and capture the imagination of students, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. One way to reach these groups is via curricula that appeals to contexts in which they’re familiar and engaged, such as sports. To that end, this project will explore the development of a sports-based introductory data science curriculum with the goal of engaging students who might otherwise not be interested in pursuing data science as a career. Students will work on generation of illustrative code examples/problem sets in Python using sports examples.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While many stories involve the friendly and familiar, scary stories across cultures, from Hamlet to Yotsuya Kaidan to Siren Head involve beings that are almost—but not quite—human. Can these stories give us insight into the “nearly-human” uncanny valley? And are the most popular stories at the nadir of this valley? In this project we aim to explore the uncanny valley through analysis of several thousand stories posted on Reddit posted over a decade. These data contain stories that cross a range of topics, and include user comments and story scores. We will explore the prevalence of the monsters over time, and explore whether there is some optimal characteristics of these monsters that make them so scary. While some research has explored the uncanny valley for images, the research is limited and virtually unexplored in text format. The students will build on initial work by the advisor to apply NLP methods to these texts and improve upon existing initial results.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The broadband access market is increasingly dominated by a few large ISPs. However, small and medium-size operators (“microtelcos”) are critical to connectivity in low-income and rural communities in CA, serving markets of little interest to large operators. The primary goal of this project is to combine broadband infrastructure deployment data from the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) and socioeconomic data from the Census Bureau to understand the characteristics of the communities served by microtelcos, and to analyze whether the presence of a microtelco operator contributes to higher levels of connectivity in the community. The main technical challenge is to combine spatial data found in CPUC files with census block level data provided by the Census Bureau. This is part of an ongoing research program called Connected Communities and Inclusive Growth (CCIG).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will result in a visual analytics toolkit that will enable social scientists to understand the cultural groups and biases at play in a social dataset. News, books, and social media all contain biases that stem from the cultural background of the author(s). We have developed algorithms to identify the cultural groups at play in an arbitrary dataset, as well as natural language processing approaches that can discover the biases of each group. This project would help bring put these tools into the hands of social scientists by displaying the output of these algorithms in novel visualizations.&lt;/p>
