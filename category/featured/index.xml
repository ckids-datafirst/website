Eating disorders, a psychiatric illness where an adolescent tries to control their weight with severe food restriction (anorexia) or purging (bulimia), can be fatal. How much does web content and algorithms that power web search contribute to eating disorders? Imagine a girl who is unhappy about her weight and looks for dieting tips online. It does not take long for search algorithms to lead her to extreme content that promotes anorexia and extreme weight loss. The goal of this project is to audit the web for potentially harmful content and communities that promote eating disorders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Natural language processing of safety reports in nuclear plants and aviation</title><link>https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2023-spring/10/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2023-spring/10/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project will focus on extracting concise structured information about incidents in nuclear plants and in aviation that are currently described in lengthy document reports. By structuring this information and mapping it to safety models and standards, we can help improve their operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transition of Care</title><link>https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2023-spring/9/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2023-spring/9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Analytics to determine what tertiary and quaternary care patients would have the best outcomes at Keck Medical Center.
