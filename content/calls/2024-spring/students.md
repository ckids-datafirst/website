        Call for USC students to attend information session for DataFirst Spring 2024
      text: |
        This event is an opportunity for data science students to learn to work in teams with people who have different skills, to learn about different application domains, and to work on projects that can only be done with creative ideas.

        Come to our information session and hear from faculty mentors about projects that will be part of DataFirst this Fall semester.  Then you can decide if you want to sign up to participate.
