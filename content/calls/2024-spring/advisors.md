        How to submit a project proposal?
      text: |
        In the past years, faculty members across several schools at USC have been collaborating through CKIDS to work on joint projects through DataFest events. In these events, faculty and senior researchers have been able to tackle new interdisciplinary topics, and engage students in data science, computer science and other disciplines to work together to formulate interesting problems and to define joint approaches to solve them.

        **Proposal deadline: TDB**
