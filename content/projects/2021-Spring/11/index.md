summary: Students will analyze images from optical microscopes that reveal features
  of materials and microstructures using machine learning techniques. These images
  have been collected by geologists, who use them to study the rock samples that they
  collect in the field and determine their properties and origins. We have a baseline
  system already implemented, and the goal is to improve it with new machine learning
  techniques, guided by the insights of our collaborating geologists.
