summary: Cyber ontologies such as STIX and ATT&CK can represent complex relationships
  between cyber threat actors, attacks, and infrastructure. While such representations
  are easily processed by computers, cyber analysts often prefer dealing with written
  text. Natural language ontologies like FrameNet represent language in a structured
  manner as well, but frame specifications are often not specific enough for a given
  domain (like cybersecurity). In this project, students will learn about cybersecurity
  threat ontologies and build a GUI web app tool that annotates provided cyber threat
  documents. No previous knowledge of cybersecurity necessary!

## Description

Cyber ontologies such as STIX and ATT&amp;CK can represent complex relationships between cyber threat actors, attacks, and infrastructure. While such representations are easily processed by computers, cyber analysts often prefer dealing with written text. Natural language ontologies like FrameNet represent language in a structured manner as well, but frame specifications are often not specific enough for a given domain (like cybersecurity). In this project, students will learn about cybersecurity threat ontologies and build a GUI web app tool that annotates provided cyber threat documents. No previous knowledge of cybersecurity necessary!
