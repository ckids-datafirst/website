summary: With the recent enthusiasm about algorithmic fairness and responsible AI,
  many conferences are encouraging or requiring a broader impact section to assess
  societal harms and benefits of the AI research being presented. In this project,
  we will analyze the themes of these sections, with a particular focus on the ethical
  issues being addressed and acknowledged. We will develop tools and methods to evaluate
  the harms and benefits of the presented research. The goal is to see how is the
  community helping AI research to be less harmful but more beneficial for society.
  For more background on work in this area, please review this workshop.
