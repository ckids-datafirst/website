summary: Internet memes are a popular tool for creatively expressing ideas on the
  Web. Machine understanding of memes would benefit researchers interested in trends,
  virality of topics, and hate speech. However, understanding memes is difficult,
  as it requires combining text, vision, and extensive background knowledge. Recently,
  we created an Internet Meme Knowledge Graph that contains rich information about
  thousands of entities. In this project, we will perform extensive profiling of the
  Internet Meme Knowledge Graph, enrich it with other sources, and store its knowledge
  into a centralized resource like Wikidata.

Recently, we created an Internet Meme Knowledge Graph that contains rich information about thousands of entities. In this project, we will perform extensive profiling of the Internet Meme Knowledge Graph, enrich it with other sources, and store its knowledge into a centralized resource like Wikidata.
