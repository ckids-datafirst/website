summary: After the COVID, the remote work environment has become popular, and many
  commercial offices have tried to keep both the in-person work environment and the
  remote work environment while attempting to reduce the size of their workplaces.
  Even though hot desking systems are increasingly common and even starting to feel
  like a trend these days, there isn't much data to show how such systems can support
  occupants' environmental comfort, work productivity, and psychological stability
  while they are at work. This project adopts a commercial office as a testbed, which
  is located in the downtown Los Angeles, and conducts questionnaire surveys, indoor
  environmental quality measurements.  The project's findings will help design this
  new desking system in a way that will increase occupants' satisfaction with their
  surroundings and productivity at work without compromising their quality of life
  in the workplace.

## Description

After the COVID, the remote work environment has become popular, and many commercial offices have tried to keep both the in-person work environment and the remote work environment while attempting to reduce the size of their workplaces. Even though hot desking systems are increasingly common and even starting to feel like a trend these days, there isn&#39;t much data to show how such systems can support occupants&#39; environmental comfort, work productivity, and psychological stability while they are at work. This project adopts a commercial office as a testbed, which is located in the downtown Los Angeles, and conducts questionnaire surveys, indoor environmental quality measurements.  The project&#39;s findings will help design this new desking system in a way that will increase occupants&#39; satisfaction with their surroundings and productivity at work without compromising their quality of life in the workplace.
