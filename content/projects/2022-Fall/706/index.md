summary:
  "Advancements in artificial intelligence, especially neural networks, have
  enabled more intelligent models that can distinguish between fake and real information.
  However, these models suffer from over-fitting: a phenomenon where models memorize
  certain patterns in the dataset instead of understanding the actual underlying task.This
  prevents the models from generalizing well, especially across domains. Quantum Natural
  Language Processing (QNLP) is a very nascent field where quantum computers solve
  NLP problems. It has been shown that QNLP models have been able to solve many of
  the aforementioned tasks difficult for neural networks to solve. This is attributed
  to the fact that QNLP models naturally incorporate rich linguistic meanings and
  structure. In this project we will create neural network like models for QNLP. This
  will be done on fact verification datasets, with the goal of improving the quality
  of fake news identification."

## Description

Advancements in artificial intelligence, especially neural networks, have enabled more intelligent models that can distinguish between fake and real information. However, these models suffer from over-fitting: a phenomenon where models memorize certain patterns in the dataset instead of understanding the actual underlying task.This prevents the models from generalizing well, especially across domains. Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is a very nascent field where quantum computers solve NLP problems. It has been shown that QNLP models have been able to solve many of the aforementioned tasks difficult for neural networks to solve. This is attributed to the fact that QNLP models naturally incorporate rich linguistic meanings and structure. In this project we will create neural network like models for QNLP.
