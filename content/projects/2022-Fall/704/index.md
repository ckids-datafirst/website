summary:
  Ever get frustrated reading a README? Wish you could just ask someone for
  help instead of reading pages of documentation, combing through StackOverflow posts,
  and consulting lecture slides? This ambitious project will build a team of students
  to convert documentation in README files, ReadTheDocs and other manual pages, and
  StackOverflow posts into short conversations. These conversations will be used to
  train a dialogue model like DialoGPT to help create an assistive chat bot that can
  answer questions about code.
