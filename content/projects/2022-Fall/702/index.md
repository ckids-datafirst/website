summary: Food production and their supply chains are the main cause of water pollution,
  especially in emerging and developed countries. Understanding the connection between
  our diet and water pollution is extremely challenging because it requires combining
  knowledge about food production, supply chains, and transportation. As more and
  more people seek to live sustainably, there is a need to inform consumers about
  the planetary impacts of their choices. We propose to construct a knowledge graph
  and application to create a water footprint calculator for our dietary choices that
  computes the water footprint for each ingredient of a meal proposed by the user
  and suggest alternatives to reduce the water footprint (e.g., replacing beef by
  pork in a cheesesteak meal will save the planet 1,600 gallons of water).
