summary: In this project, we will work on semantically aligning IoT sensor data and
  neural data with the human experience. We have developed a sensor platform to record
  the human experience as patients perform navigational tasks. The goal is to understand
  what context shifts in the human experience anchor our episodic memories. Each student
  will have the opportunity to work with different sensing modalities, and develop
  models for both sensory perception and reasoning.

## Description

In this project, we will work on semantically aligning IoT sensor data and neural data with the human experience. We have developed a sensor platform to record the human experience as patients perform navigational tasks. The goal is to understand what context shifts in the human experience anchor our episodic memories. Each student will have the opportunity to work with different sensing modalities, and develop models for both sensory perception and reasoning.
