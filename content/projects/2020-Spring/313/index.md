## Description

This project will measure representation of women in various scientific disciplines across time (and different countries) and identify institutions who have succeeded in creating a more welcoming environment for women. While there are already studies that use bibliographic data to map career trajectories of women, they do not focus on the role that institutions (and countries) – and their policies – play in retaining female researchers.

The data comes from Microscoft Academic Graph, containing millions of papers from institutions around the world across many decades. We will use Ethenea API to extract gender (and ethnicity) of authors.
