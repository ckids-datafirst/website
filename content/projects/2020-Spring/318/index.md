summary:
  Libraries, museums, and archives hold unique collections that may be very
  useful for data science. These collections include photographs, videos, letters,
  and other artifacts that could give unique insights when analyzed. In this project,
  students will work with the USC Libraries to identify existing collections that
  would be potentially interesting as targets for data science, describe those collections
  in collaboration with the USC Libraries so they can be promoted as data science
  resources, and create APIs and other access mechanisms for data science researchers
  on campus and beyond.
