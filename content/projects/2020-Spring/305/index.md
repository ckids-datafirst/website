summary: "This project will look at events data collected at several recent feminist\
  \ social movements and understand their connection to each other. Specifically,\
  \ it will explore individuals or organizations that played instrumental role in\
  \ movement mobilization, relationship brokerage between movements, and building\
  \ and sustaining activist communities.  Previous research suggests that those distinctive\
  \ movements are often not isolated incidents, but mobilized by a core group of \u201C\
  leaders\u201D or similar ideas and frames. The goal is to understand how seemingly\
  \ disconnected movements relate to one another help to reveal the lasting impact\
  \ of mediated movements."

## Description

This project will look at events data collected at several recent feminist social movements and understand their connection to each other. Specifically, it will explore individuals or organizations that played instrumental role in movement mobilization, relationship brokerage between movements, and building and sustaining activist communities.  Previous research suggests that those distinctive movements are often not isolated incidents, but mobilized by a core group of “leaders” or similar ideas and frames. The goal is to understand how seemingly disconnected movements relate to one another help to reveal the lasting impact of mediated movements.
