summary: Paleoclimate data is highly diverse, requiring different sets of metadata
  to describe the various datasets. In this project, you will help build an interface
  to assist researchers in annotating their paleoclimate datasets according to an
  evolving reporting standard (PaCTS) and download them in the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD)
  format. The interface should be highly interactive (wizard) to accommodate the diversity
  of the data as well as offer editing capabilities for existing datasets (upload
  LiPD files) and check their compliance with PaCTS, plot location information and
  the time series, download into the LiPD format, upload to a semantic wiki and/or
  an SQL database. In addition, the interface should support the use of a recommender
  system (to be build) to help researchers in annotating their datasets.

## Description

Paleoclimate data is highly diverse, requiring different sets of metadata to describe the various datasets.

The interface should be highly interactive (wizard) to accommodate the diversity of the data as well as offer editing capabilities for existing datasets (upload LiPD files) and check their compliance with PaCTS, plot location information and the time series, download into the LiPD format, upload to a semantic wiki and/or an SQL database.
