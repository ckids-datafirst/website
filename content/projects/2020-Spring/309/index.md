summary: Induced seismicity refers to earthquakes that are caused as a result of human
  activity, such as disposing of wastewater by injecting it into the subsurface. This
  project will focus on spatiotemporal statistics to model space-time relationships
  between injected wastewater and induced earthquakes. The model will incorporate
  space-time data pertaining to seismic activity and associated human systems to create
  forecasts of induced earthquakes.
