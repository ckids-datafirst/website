summary: Documenting how a result was obtained from data analysis involves documenting
  the software, software settings, and datasets used to obtain that result so it can
  be explained properly. The current ASSET interface enables users to document the
  provenance of data analysis no matter what infrastructure they used (R scripts,
  sk-learn, etc). This project will focus on capturing provenance records for data
  science projects and using the W3C PROV standard to export those records. It will
  also develop tools to mine provenance data to find common patterns of use.
