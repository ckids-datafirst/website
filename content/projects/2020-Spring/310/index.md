summary: This project will develop a data scraper to collect salary records from a
  website that provides compensation data for faculty at public universities. When
  provided a list of faculty names and institutional affiliations, this program will
  search for the associated records, extract the relevant results, and copy the data
  into a spreadsheet. The purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility of
  automating an otherwise time-consuming data collection task required for benchmarking
  of faculty salaries in relation to peer institutions. This will ultimately facilitate
  a number of important tasks, including analysis of potential salary disparities
  within certain disciplines and faculty tracks.

## Description

This project will develop a data scraper to collect salary records from a website that provides compensation data for faculty at public universities. When provided a list of faculty names and institutional affiliations, this program will search for the associated records, extract the relevant results, and copy the data into a spreadsheet. The purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility of automating an otherwise time-consuming data collection task required for benchmarking of faculty salaries in relation to peer institutions. This will ultimately facilitate a number of important tasks, including analysis of potential salary disparities within certain disciplines and faculty tracks.
