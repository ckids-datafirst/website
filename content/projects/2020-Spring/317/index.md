summary: Politicians in modern democracies across the world have eagerly adopted social
  media for engaging their constituents, entering into direct dialogs with citizens.
  From the perspective of political actors, there is a need to continuously gather,
  monitor, analyze, and visualize politically relevant information from online social
  media with the goal to improve communication with citizens and voters. The goal
  of this proposal is to create a tool that enhances interaction and dialogue between
  political actors and their followers. This will be achieved by creating compact
  and comprehensive summaries that aggregate and visualizes common narratives, thus,
  reducing the cognitive load required to read all the messages and streamlining the
  dialogue experience.
