summary: Droughts can have a substantial impact on agricultural systems and human
  livelihood. A Python package to calculate various drought indices in being developed.
  In this project, you will expand on this package and develop methods to test the
  sensitivity of the models to various input datasets and parameters. In addition,
  you will develop post-processing code to determine the return period of the drought
  (is it a 1 in 20 yr event or 1 in 5 yr event?).
