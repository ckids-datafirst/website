summary: "Estimates of climate variations over the past 1,000 years play an increasing\
  \ role in climate assessments.  A key quantity to derive from them is the transient\
  \ climate response (TCR), which quantifies the warming at expected from slowly-rising\
  \ CO2 concentrations. TCR helps constrain the climate models used to predict the\
  \ future evolution of Earth\u2019s climate. In this project, you will help design\
  \ an efficient workflow to estimate TCR from existing paleoclimate datasets and\
  \ emerging statistical methods."

## Description

Estimates of climate variations over the past 1,000 years play an increasing role in climate assessments.  A key quantity to derive from them is the transient climate response (TCR), which quantifies the warming at expected from slowly-rising CO2 concentrations. TCR helps constrain the climate models used to predict the future evolution of Earthâ€™s climate. In this project, you will help design an efficient workflow to estimate TCR from existing paleoclimate datasets and emerging statistical methods.
