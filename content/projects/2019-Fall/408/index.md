summary: This project will result in an open-source software tool that will have general
  applicability for scientific publications. Papers with hundreds of authors are not
  uncommon in science, and it often takes many weeks to compile an author list in
  the desired order with proper affiliations and acknowledgments. We have implemented
  an algorithm that generates the author information for a paper based on the type
  of contribution of each author within the ENIGMA neuroscience consortium. This project
  would extend this software to read in compiled spreadsheets or forms and extract
  information about universities and other institutions from structured web sources,
  to interoperate with widely-used frameworks such as Wikidata.
