summary: This project will investigate the quality of Instagram textual posts as a
  source of data for measurements of dietary patterns and nutrition quality, focusing
  on spatial and textual features of posts linked to food outlets. Using an Instagram
  dataset of all geo-located posts at food outlets in Los Angeles for 3 months in
  2014, this project will investigate whether Instagram posts, despite implicit biases
  (and to the extent possible, accounting for these biases), can provide a representative
  health signal, informative of the quality of population nutrition and dietary patterns
  at a highly-resolved (e.g. census tract level) spatial scale.
