summary: Many musicians, from up-and-comers to established artists, rely heavily on
  performing live to promote and disseminate their music. To advertise live shows,
  artists often use concert discovery platforms that make it easier for their fans
  to track tour dates. In this project, we ask whether digital traces of musical performances
  generated on those platforms can be used to understand career trajectories of artists.
  We have amassed a dataset we constructed by cross-referencing data from such platforms
  (Songkick, and Discogs). In this project, you will identify and explore patterns
  that can be used to identify successful musicians.
