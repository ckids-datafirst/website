summary: Using real-time big data from Los Angeles freeways on traffic and Aclima
  data on pollution measurements, this project will estimate the links between speed
  and pollution. Estimating this relationship properly is crucial for knowing the
  benefits that congestion pricing may generate in terms of pollution reduction. Computer
  Science methods will be used to guide the choice of policy intervention and guide
  prediction.
