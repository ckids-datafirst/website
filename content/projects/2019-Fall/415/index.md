## Description

LA Care has a mission to “provide access to quality health care for Los Angeles County’s vulnerable and low-income communities and residents and to support the safety net required to achieve that purpose.” In the many coordinated activities LA Care conducts to provide a comprehensive health insurance safety net, it collects massive amounts of healthcare data. With advances in analytics enabled by AI approaches (e.g. predictive modeling, machine learning, model refinement and validation), the organization is looking for ways to mine and analyze its data to drive optimization and improvement of product development, marketing techniques and business strategies. Students will work with stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging company data to drive business solutions. The ability to identify and address “pain points” will depend on the skills that students bring to the project.
