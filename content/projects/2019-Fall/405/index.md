summary: "Human, as a building occupant, is always surrounded by several indoor environmental\
  \ quality (IEQ) elements, such as thermal, visual, air, and acoustic conditions.\
  \ Therefore, the user\u2019s environmental comfort and work productivity are significantly\
  \ affected by the IEQ conditions, especially in residential, office, and educational\
  \ facilities. This research is to investigate the relationships between the user\u2019\
  s IEQ comfort perceptions, IEQ conditions and his/her bio-metric signals to understand\
  \ how to identify individual IEQ perception as a function of single or combined\
  \ bio-signals (changes). The study outcome will have a potential to be integrated\
  \ with the existing building mechanical/electrical control systems to enhance the\
  \ user\u2019s IEQ conditions while contributing to his/her comfort and well-being\
  \ in the built environment."

## Description

Human, as a building occupant, is always surrounded by several indoor environmental quality (IEQ) elements, such as thermal, visual, air, and acoustic conditions. Therefore, the user’s environmental comfort and work productivity are significantly affected by the IEQ conditions, especially in residential, office, and educational facilities. This research is to investigate the relationships between the user’s IEQ comfort perceptions, IEQ conditions and his/her bio-metric signals to understand how to identify individual IEQ perception as a function of single or combined bio-signals (changes). The study outcome will have a potential to be integrated with the existing building mechanical/electrical control systems to enhance the user’s IEQ conditions while contributing to his/her comfort and well-being in the built environment.
