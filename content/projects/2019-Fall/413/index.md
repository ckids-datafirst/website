summary: While many open data efforts have managed to successfully expose public data
  in the web, it is often complicated to determine how these records can be integrated
  with each other (due to heterogeneous ids, not clear how to place them into a map,
  etc.). In this project, the student will leverage the novel techniques for integrating,
  registering and connecting datasets with overlapping elements. The results will
  be visualized by the student using interactive maps.

In this project, the student will leverage the novel techniques for integrating, registering and connecting datasets with overlapping elements. The results will be visualized by the student using interactive maps.
