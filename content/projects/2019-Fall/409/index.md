summary: This project will result in a visual analytics toolkit that will enable social
  scientists to understand the cultural groups and biases at play in a social dataset.
  News, books, and social media all contain biases that stem from the cultural background
  of the author(s). We have developed algorithms to identify the cultural groups at
  play in an arbitrary dataset, as well as natural language processing approaches
  that can discover the biases of each group. This project would help bring put these
  tools into the hands of social scientists by displaying the output of these algorithms
  in novel visualizations.
