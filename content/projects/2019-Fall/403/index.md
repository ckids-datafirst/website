## Description

Since 1992, the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies ‘Catalina Conservation Divers’ have been collecting underwater biological and environmental data from coastal ocean sites around Catalina Island, California. In cooperation with the USC Wrigley Institute, the CCD team (made up of community scientists and volunteer SCUBA divers) conducts quarterly surveys of marine species and benthic water temperatures at various depths and locations. The Wrigley Institute has been collecting and archiving this data for years, and the data has not been holistically studied to date. We need assistance in analyzing data for trends across location, ocean depth, and time.
