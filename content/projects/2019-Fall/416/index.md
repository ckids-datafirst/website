summary: Documenting how a result was obtained from data analysis involves documenting
  the software, software settings, and datasets used to obtain that result so it can
  be explained properly. This project will design and develop a user interface for
  specifying provenance records using W3C standards. The interface will enable users
  to document the provenance of data analysis no matter what infrastructure they used
  (R scripts, sk-learn, etc).

Documenting how a result was obtained from data analysis involves documenting the software, software settings, and datasets used to obtain that result so it can be explained properly. This project will design and develop a user interface for specifying provenance records using W3C standards. The interface will enable users to document the provenance of data analysis no matter what infrastructure they used (R scripts, sk-learn, etc).
