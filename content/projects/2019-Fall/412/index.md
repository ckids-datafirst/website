## Description

A lot of data is available in the web in a tabular manner, but itâ€™s difficult to manipulate and visualize without a significant effort. In this project, we aim to test a novel framework created at ISI to build and visualize knowledge bases. The objective is to create a knowledge base that extends the other resources in the Web such as Wikidata or Wikipedia, and visualize the results using interactive maps and plots.
