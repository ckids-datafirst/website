## Description

Open source runs a lot of the world&#39;s critical software systems, but there is much that&#39;s unknown in how maintainers, developers and other parts of the software ecosystem function.  Help us analyze a large corpus of open source data — both source code and patch conversations — to better understand them!  We&#39;ll study things like rise to influence, authorship styles, malware analysis, topic modeling and social network analysis!
