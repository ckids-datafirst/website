summary: Highly accurate fault detection in foundry produced microelectronics is crucial
  to ensuring quality of devices that leave the foundry. However, current defect detection
  flows are human-centric, which produces a bottleneck. The objective of this project
  is to leverage recent advances in AI/ML to develop automated techniques that can
  1) identify manufacturing defects in microelectronics using imagery collected at
  the foundry, and 2) determine whether the identified defect will impact the performance
  of the manufactured component.

## Description

Highly accurate fault detection in foundry produced microelectronics is crucial to ensuring quality of devices that leave the foundry. However, current defect detection flows are human-centric, which produces a bottleneck. The objective of this project is to leverage recent advances in AI/ML to develop automated techniques that can 1) identify manufacturing defects in microelectronics using imagery collected at the foundry, and 2) determine whether the identified defect will impact the performance of the manufactured component.
