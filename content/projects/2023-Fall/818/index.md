summary: Broadband networks owned and/or operated by local governments ("muni networks")
  are increasingly seen as a key tool to close the digital divide in Internet availability
  and adoption.   There is however only anecdotal evidence about whether muni networks
  deliver on the promise of more affordable broadband in communities of little interest
  to traditional ISPs - typically disadvantaged communities. Taking advantage of the
  greater level of resolution in the new FCC broadband availability maps, this project
  will examine broadband pricing and adoption at the address level in areas served
  by muni networks, using a matched sample of comparable areas as a reference point.
  The goal of the project is to empirically assert whether muni networks are delivering
  on the promise of more affordable services, and whether this results in more household
  adoption than expected. The project is a component of an ongoing collaboration with
  digital equity advocacy organizations.

## Description

Broadband networks owned and/or operated by local governments (&#34;muni networks&#34;) are increasingly seen as a key tool to close the digital divide in Internet availability and adoption.   There is however only anecdotal evidence about whether muni networks deliver on the promise of more affordable broadband in communities of little interest to traditional ISPs - typically disadvantaged communities. Taking advantage of the greater level of resolution in the new FCC broadband availability maps, this project will examine broadband pricing and adoption at the address level in areas served by muni networks, using a matched sample of comparable areas as a reference point. The goal of the project is to empirically assert whether muni networks are delivering on the promise of more affordable services, and whether this results in more household adoption than expected. The project is a component of an ongoing collaboration with digital equity advocacy organizations.
