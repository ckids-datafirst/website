## Description

Federated learning is an approach to distributed deep learning without sharing data. Multiple site train a neural network over private data. The parameters of the neural network are shared with a federation controller, but they are encrypted before sharing. Model aggregation is performed under fully homomorphic encryption. We propose to apply federated learning to several problems in neuroscience, such as predicting Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s, epilepsy, and autism, possibly over multimodal data.
