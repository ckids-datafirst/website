summary: Public sector institutions at local, state, and federal levels are facing
  an unprecedented hiring crisis in competition for new talent. Yet there is no systematic
  understanding of the needs and openings across these levels of government to inform
  stakeholders such as universities, community colleges, and high schools on the current
  and emerging hiring trends in what constitutes approximately 15-20% of the entire
  labor market. In this project, students will develop algorithms that continuously
  scrap relevant job sites used by these governments to assess both developed and
  emerging hiring trends by aptitudes, professions, entry-levels, mobility, location,
  and other important attributes. In so doing, the project will inform researchers
  in public policy, public administration, political science, and labor economics
  as well as practitioners in government and associated stakeholders.

## Description

Public sector institutions at local, state, and federal levels are facing an unprecedented hiring crisis in competition for new talent. Yet there is no systematic understanding of the needs and openings across these levels of government to inform stakeholders such as universities, community colleges, and high schools on the current and emerging hiring trends in what constitutes approximately 15-20% of the entire labor market. In this project, students will develop algorithms that continuously scrap relevant job sites used by these governments to assess both developed and emerging hiring trends by aptitudes, professions, entry-levels, mobility, location, and other important attributes. In so doing, the project will inform researchers in public policy, public administration, political science, and labor economics as well as practitioners in government and associated stakeholders.
