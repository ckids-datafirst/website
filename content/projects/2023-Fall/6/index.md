Highly accurate fault detection in foundry produced microelectronics is crucial to ensuring quality of devices that leave the foundry. However, current defect detection flows are human-centric, which produces a bottleneck. The objective of this project is to leverage recent advances in AI/ML to develop automated techniques that can:

1. Identify manufacturing defects in microelectronics using imagery collected at the foundry
2. Determine whether the identified defect will impact the performance of the manufactured component.
