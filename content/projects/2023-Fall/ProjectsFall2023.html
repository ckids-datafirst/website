<tr><td>Developing image-based object detection and classification models requires significant time, resources, and effort. Especially, acquiring a good training dataset is essential. However, there are some cases when it is very hard to get quality data such as rare cases (e.g., disasters) or expensive cases to get (e.g., faraway places). Due to the development of generative AI, we might produce synthetic images to enhance the quality of dataset by filling up missing images with them. Based on our prior work in object detection and classification for smart city applications, we would like to explore the potential of AI generated images for an enhanced object detection and classification.

<tr><td>Cities are the focal point of economic, social, and environmental challenges and opportunities. To establish USC as a thought leader and partner of choice to tackle the challenges of the urban future, the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy and the USC Marshall School of Business propose establishing an Urban Futures Data Core to serve as a university-wide hub for data analysis and dissemination. Students working on this project will work with all faculty at Price and Marshall to catalogue the publicly available, restricted-use, and self-collected datasets that USC researchers have previously used. They will then create a secure website to track each data source and its data use agreements, dates of availability, and geographic level of granularity. After a data website is constructed, students will have the opportunity to assist with creating geographic visualizations of key indices related to urban futures. </td></tr>

Pyleoclim contains many functionalities for timeseries analysis of paleoclimate data and has already been used in teaching and research settings.

Yet there is no systematic understanding of the needs and openings across these levels of government to inform stakeholders such as universities, community colleges, and high schools on the current and emerging hiring trends in what constitutes approximately 15-20% of the entire labor market. In this project, students will develop algorithms that continuously scrap relevant job sites used by these governments to assess both developed and emerging hiring trends by aptitudes, professions, entry-levels, mobility, location, and other important attributes. In so doing, the project will inform researchers in public policy, public administration, political science, and labor economics as well as practitioners in government and associated stakeholders.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Broadband networks owned and/or operated by local governments (&quot;muni networks&quot;) are increasingly seen as a key tool to close the digital divide in Internet availability and adoption.   There is however only anecdotal evidence about whether muni networks deliver on the promise of more affordable broadband in communities of little interest to traditional ISPs - typically disadvantaged communities. Taking advantage of the greater level of resolution in the new FCC broadband availability maps, this project will examine broadband pricing and adoption at the address level in areas served by muni networks, using a matched sample of comparable areas as a reference point. The goal of the project is to empirically assert whether muni networks are delivering on the promise of more affordable services, and whether this results in more household adoption than expected. The project is a component of an ongoing collaboration with digital equity advocacy organizations.</td></tr>
