summary: 'Cities are the focal point of economic, social, and environmental challenges
  and opportunities. To establish USC as a thought leader and partner of choice to
  tackle the challenges of the urban future, the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy
  and the USC Marshall School of Business propose establishing an Urban Futures Data
  Core to serve as a university-wide hub for data analysis and dissemination. Students
  working on this project will work with all faculty at Price and Marshall to catalogue
  the publicly available, restricted-use, and self-collected datasets that USC researchers
  have previously used. They will then create a secure website to track each data
  source and its data use agreements, dates of availability, and geographic level
  of granularity. After a data website is constructed, students will have the opportunity
  to assist with creating geographic visualizations of key indices related to urban
  futures. '

## Description

Cities are the focal point of economic, social, and environmental challenges and opportunities. To establish USC as a thought leader and partner of choice to tackle the challenges of the urban future, the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy and the USC Marshall School of Business propose establishing an Urban Futures Data Core to serve as a university-wide hub for data analysis and dissemination. Students working on this project will work with all faculty at Price and Marshall to catalogue the publicly available, restricted-use, and self-collected datasets that USC researchers have previously used. They will then create a secure website to track each data source and its data use agreements, dates of availability, and geographic level of granularity. After a data website is constructed, students will have the opportunity to assist with creating geographic visualizations of key indices related to urban futures.
