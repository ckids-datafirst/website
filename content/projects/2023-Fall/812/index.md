## Description

Developing image-based object detection and classification models requires significant time, resources, and effort. Especially, acquiring a good training dataset is essential. However, there are some cases when it is very hard to get quality data such as rare cases (e.g., disasters) or expensive cases to get (e.g., faraway places). Due to the development of generative AI, we might produce synthetic images to enhance the quality of dataset by filling up missing images with them. Based on our prior work in object detection and classification for smart city applications, we would like to explore the potential of AI generated images for an enhanced object detection and classification.
