## Description

Open-source intelligence (“OSINT”) is a rapidly growing area of cybersecurity. This project seeks to explore OSINT information available on GitHub. We’ll use the GitHub API and related tools to build networks to try to answer a number of interesting questions, such as “can you tell what software a company uses based on its employees networks?”, “do white hat hackers have social networks that look different than black hatters?” and others. If you’re interested in cybersecurity, OSINT, social networks, databases, APIs etc. then this is the project for you!
