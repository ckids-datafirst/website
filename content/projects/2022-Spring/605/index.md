## Description

Novel, or hypothesized medical treatments, such as COVID-19 vaccines and male contraception, are regularly discussed on social media. For example, on the AskReddit subreddit, questions of the form “”Would you take [x] if it existed?”” Aside from willingness to use these novel treatments, the answers to these questions contain important clues to peoples’ latent concerns and barriers to adoption of novel medications. Understanding them can provide crucial information about how to introduce, communicate, and counsel about new medications when they come to market. In this project you will use pre-collected Reddit data spanning 10 years to answer questions including: What concerns do individuals have about a novel medication? How do these concerns vary by demographics, such as cultural background? How have these concerns evolved over time? What has caused users to become more or less accepting of the treatment over time?
