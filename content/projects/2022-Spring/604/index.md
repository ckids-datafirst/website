summary:
  Our group focuses on the question of how to design a learning framework that
  promote the generalizability of machine learning models. In this project, you will
  focus on exploring how neural networks acquire information from the training examples
  and how they learn to solve various physical problems (e.g., emulation of simple
  quantum systems). The premise of this project is that by observing how a machine
  learning model learns to solve the specific task, we can learn about the underlying
  problem itself. As an example, by analyzing the weights of a trained neural network,
  you can discover non-trivial symmetries of the modeled physical system, determine
  the relative importance of features, or identify some non-trivial interplay between
  underlying physical mechanisms. Your task would be to learn various tools for interpreting
  deep neural networks. You will test them in practice and you will explore methods
  that promote model transparency and interpretability.
