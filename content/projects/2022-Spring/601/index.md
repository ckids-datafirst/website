summary: This is an interdisciplinary data science project that involves aspects and
  requires expertise from quantum information theory and machine learning. In this
  project we plan to develop and implement a novel approach to substantially improving
  the performance of quantum computers using advancements in the area of machine learning
  enabled fault detection and diagnosis. We will adapt and further develop existing
  machine learning protocols to efficiently and reliably detect and diagnose faulty
  quantum circuits. The protocols are expected to reach beyond the capabilities of
  current arts in the error diagnosis of quantum circuits, and to provide detailed
  and transparent information about various sources of errors in the quantum circuits
  with significantly fewer queries to the quantum circuit and considerably fewer repeated
  experiments. This project will allow student to learn and acquire expertise in topics
  that cross quantum information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning.
