summary: The pandemic worsened eating disorders among adolescents, particularly girls.
  Eating disorders, a psychiatric illness where an adolescent tries to control their
  weight with severe food restriction (anorexia) or purging (bulimia), can be fatal.
  How much does web content and algorithms that power web search contribute to eating
  disorders?  Imagine a girl who is unhappy about her weight and looks for dieting
  tips online. It does not take long for search algorithms to lead her to extreme
  content that promotes anorexia and extreme weight loss. The goal of this project
  is to audit the web for potentially harmful content and communities that promote
  eating disorders.
