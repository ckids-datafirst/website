summary: 'To predict the possibility of escalation of care for specific cohorts admitted
  to Keck ICU,), on the following: Increase in pressors, Intubation, Trip to operating
  room within 24 hours, Starting dialysis The objective is to predict on a real-time/near
  real-time basis, whether someone is likely to require escalated care as defined
  above. Prediction of the likelihood of such a care escalation need is assumed to
  be an optional/secondary requirement at this stage.'
