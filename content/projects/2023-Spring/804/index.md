summary: Students will learn to collect and analyze data in the goal of identifying
  causal pathways between online and offline systems. Video games, present a rich
  set of opportunities for this analysis, and we will begin by studying them. We will
  start with the effect that video games have on culture, movement, and discussion
  offline. We will then transition to Reddit activity, where certain communities can
  spur offline action. Students will not only collect data, but apply state-of-the-art
  causal detection algorithms alongside PhD students studying the same phenomena.

## Description

Students will learn to collect and analyze data in the goal of identifying causal pathways between online and offline systems. Video games, present a rich set of opportunities for this analysis, and we will begin by studying them. We will start with the effect that video games have on culture, movement, and discussion offline. We will then transition to Reddit activity, where certain communities can spur offline action. Students will not only collect data, but apply state-of-the-art causal detection algorithms alongside PhD students studying the same phenomena.
