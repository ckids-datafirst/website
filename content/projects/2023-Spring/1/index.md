summary: There is anecdotal evidence that broadband service offers vary in quality
  and price along income and racial lines. This project seeks to validate these claims
  by collecting data about service speeds and prices for all known serviceable locations
  in Los Angeles County, and merging with sociodemographic variables from the Census
  Bureau and other sources. Other researchers have already developed prototype code
  for scraping data from ISP's websites, but the study only covered a small percentage
  of addresses in LA County. The analysis will probe for evidence of a "poverty penalty"
  whereby residents of poorer areas in Los Angeles are offered higher cost/lower quality
  broadband services.
