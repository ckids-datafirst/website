## Description

To predict the possibility of escalation of care for specific cohorts admitted to Keck ICU,), on the following:
• Increase in pressors
• Intubation
• Trip to operating room within 24 hours
• Starting dialysis
The objective is to predict on a real-time/near real-time basis, whether someone is likely to require escalated care as defined above. Prediction of the likelihood of such a care escalation need is assumed to be an optional/secondary requirement at this stage.
