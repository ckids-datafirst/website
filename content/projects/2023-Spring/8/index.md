summary: Wearable IMU and GPS sensors are used to estimate training volume in professional
  sports to ensure adequate preparation for competition. Recommendations to modify
  training is individualized to meet health and performance needs of each player.
  Expense associated with these systems restrict their use in youth sports. More economical
  alternatives are available but it is not clear if the data is comparable. This project
  will compare data collected concurrently to determine if the economical system provides
  similar conclusions. Players from the LA Galaxy (second and developmental teams)
  will participate. Continuous data from triaxial accelerometers, gyroscope and GPS
  will be collected during practice and competition. Raw data and commercially derived
  key performance indicators will be compared to understand the agreement between
  the systems. Acceptable agreement with comparable interpretation of data with respect
  to training recommendations may allow for greater access for young athletes
