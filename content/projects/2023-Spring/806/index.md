summary: 'Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) models incorporate temporal aspects of facts
  into their graph neural networks (GNNs) learning processes to predict temporally
  conditioned facts. These models capture the temporal dynamics of the facts well
  and are well-suited for temporally conditioned graph completion tasks. However,
  there remain many open issues that need to be addressed to make it more practical
  for real-world applications: (1) Real-world problems usually do not conform to the
  graph completion tasks which fill out the missing element in a fact; (2) Sparse
  graph due to lack of temporal triples for target task leads to poor performance;
  (3) Temporal graphs are inherently dynamic entities that grow and change over time
  but most existing models require computationally expensive training from scratch
  to incorporate these changes. Thus, we propose to design an efficient event forecasting
  framework that solves such challenges.'

## Description

Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) models incorporate temporal aspects of facts into their graph neural networks (GNNs) learning processes to predict temporally conditioned facts. These models capture the temporal dynamics of the facts well and are well-suited for temporally conditioned graph completion tasks. However, there remain many open issues that need to be addressed to make it more practical for real-world applications: (1) Real-world problems usually do not conform to the graph completion tasks which fill out the missing element in a fact; (2) Sparse graph due to lack of temporal triples for target task leads to poor performance; (3) Temporal graphs are inherently dynamic entities that grow and change over time but most existing models require computationally expensive training from scratch to incorporate these changes. Thus, we propose to design an efficient event forecasting framework that solves such challenges.
