summary: The goal of this project is to assist clinicians to find the best course
  of treatment for a cancer patient based on the latest and most appropriate clinical
  trials. Because new drugs are appearing increasingly fast, it is hard to keep track
  of the outcomes of all clinical trials and determine the best treatment. In collaboration
  with biomedical researchers, we have been developing algorithms to extract information
  about clinical trials from government websites, to structure the information, and
  to find the clinical trials that are most relevant for a given patient. We want
  to improve the algorithms to structure this information, and to develop similarity
  metrics that will help us retrieve and rank clinical trials.
