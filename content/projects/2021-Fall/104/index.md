## Description

“Open-source intelligence (“OSINT”) is a rapidly growing area of cybersecurity. This project seeks to explore OSINT information available on GitHub. Specifically, we will build and analyze a dataset comprised of users on GitHub who show a specific interest in GitHub repos related to hacking artifacts. This dataset and social network analysis could help us determine what attributes lead to “black hat” — or malicious — cyber actors.”
