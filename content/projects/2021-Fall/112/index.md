## Description

This research will be conducted to find out the relationship between humans’ bio-signals and electrochromic windows, which is useful to create a possible mechanism of using bio-signals to control the windows. By using wearable sensors and remote sensors, subjects’ bio-signals like heart rate, skin temperature, and pupil sizes, and indoor environmental quality like temperature and humidity could be monitored and analyzed. At last, by utilizing machine learning and data analysis skills, the impacts on humans’ bio-signals could be analyzed.
