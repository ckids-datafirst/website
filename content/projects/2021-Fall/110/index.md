summary: Developing models to analyze images is a demanding task that requires significant
  time, resources, and effort. Recently, companies such as Amazon and Google are providing
  services to make the modeling process easier so even users with little machine learning
  expertise can enjoy deep learning technologies. Based on our prior work in object
  detection and classification for smart city applications, we would like to compare
  and evaluate the process and performance of commercial services using our training
  datasets. This project will be a good practice to understand the image machine learning
  modeling process and the advantages/limitations of commercial services for customized
  learning.
