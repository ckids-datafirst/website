summary: Common sense knowledge bases are used widely in research, spanning many areas
  in artificial intelligence, including natural language understanding, computer vision,
  and planning. However, these resources may contain human biases, which will ultimately
  be embedded in the resulting AI solution and potentially have negative societal
  impacts. The extent to which these biases exist is unclear. In this project, you
  will define several well-motivated biases (location, gender, ethnicity) and measure
  the extent to which they are represented in ConceptNet.

## Description

Common sense knowledge bases are used widely in research, spanning many areas in artificial intelligence, including natural language understanding, computer vision, and planning. However, these resources may contain human biases, which will ultimately be embedded in the resulting AI solution and potentially have negative societal impacts. The extent to which these biases exist is unclear. In this project, you will define several well-motivated biases (location, gender, ethnicity) and measure the extent to which they are represented in ConceptNet.
