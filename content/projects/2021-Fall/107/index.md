## Description

This new project attempts to understand the interaction between anti-vaxxers (anti-vaccination groups) and alt-right groups on platforms such as Facebook. The goal of this project is to understand how do these two types of fringe groups interact over the years, and how do their interactions and discourse evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be interesting to explore the longitudinal patterns of network/discourse co-evolution and how such patterns may change in times of dramatic events.In terms of data, I have access to Facebook’s historical data archive and I have collected a dataset that contains a list of anti-vaxxer (n=158) and alt-right groups’ (n=183) Facebook posts over 10 years (2010-2021). The dataset can be further expanded with additional help.
