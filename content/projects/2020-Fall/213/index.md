summary: College football recruiting is big business. This project aims to determine
  if there are biases in who and how college football coaches recruit players. By
  creating a comprehensive data set of college recruits and integrating relevant data
  with current socioeconomic markers (i.e. census data) we hope to determine if there
  are patterns in who and where football coaches recruit their players, regardless
  of talent.
