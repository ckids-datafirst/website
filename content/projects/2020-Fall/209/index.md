## Description

Attribution of cyber threat actors is an increasingly important and difficult problem. One potential mitigation is the early detection of potential threat actors via analysis of open-source intelligence (OSINT). This project will analyze the social graph of users who contribute to, follow, star, and otherwise interact with proof-of-concept CVE implementations and other relevant potentially malicious (e.g. software vulnerability) repositories on GitHub.
