## Description

As the requirements for success in the workforce become increasingly technical, there is a commensurate need for curricula that can engage and capture the imagination of students, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. One way to reach these groups is via curricula that appeals to contexts in which theyâ€™re familiar and engaged, such as sports. To that end, this project will explore the development of a sports-based introductory data science curriculum with the goal of engaging students who might otherwise not be interested in pursuing data science as a career. Students will work on generation of illustrative code examples/problem sets in Python using sports examples.
