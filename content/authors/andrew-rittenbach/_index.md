Dr. Andrew Rittenbach graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a PhD in Electrical Engineering and specializes in signal processing and imaging. During his graduate work, he developed a signal processing toolchain for calibration of a CdZnTe ring detector used for simultaneous single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance (MR) medical imaging. In his current role as a computer scientist at USC ISI, he has taken an interest in using machine learning techniques to tackle signal processing problems such as synthetic aperture radar image formation and IR laser detection.
