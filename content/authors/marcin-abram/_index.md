Iâ€™m a theoretical physicist. I work at the University of Southern California as a Visiting Assistant Professor with a secondary appointment at the Information Sciences Institute as a Visiting Researcher. I have experience in theoretical physics (condensed matter physics), machine learning, and decentralized systems. Prior to this appointment, I was a Lead Research Scientist in an AI&Blockchain company, working on novel consensus protocols, blockchain security, and decentralized machine learning. My current research interests focus on applications of machine learning in various areas of physics (e.g., in condensed matter physics or quantum information) and materials sciences.
