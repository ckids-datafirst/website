Expert in climate science, especially global warming, El Nino/La Nina, climate mitigation

My lab studies how climate varies on timescales comparable to a human lifetime: the [bassline of climate](https://forecastpod.org/2018/12/20/episode-50-julien-emile-geay/). We blend data and models (both deterministic and probabilistic) to shed light on climate system behavior, with a particular focus on constraining how much of climate variations arise from within, or are being triggered by external factors, natural or human.

Beyond climate science, I also teach the art of making reliable inferences from data, which is increasingly needed to cut through the cloud of misinformation, and provides economic opportunities for underrepresented groups. I am passionate about educating people of all levels of scientific literacy to the reality of man-made global warming, using evidence-based knowledge to empower individuals to generate positive change. Press [here](http://climdyn.usc.edu/assets/pdf/JEG_USC_CV23.pdf) for a detailed CV. For a recent presentation on paleoclimate data science, see [this video](https://youtu.be/2kxWQHwpo1c?t=17).  For recent publications, see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OVti4jEAAAAJ).

I am always looking for motivated students, whether for a sumemr internship or a 5-year PhD program, so don't be shy about emailing me!
