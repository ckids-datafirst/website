At DataFirst, advisors play a crucial role in guiding and supporting students as they embark on real-world data science projects.

1. Advisors should submit their project proposals to the DataFirst program coordinators during the designated submission period.

2. The projects will be presented to the students at the kick-off event.

3. The students will then select the projects they are interested in working on.

4. Advisors will select the students they want to work with on their projects.

5. Advisors will guide and mentor the students as they work on the projects.
