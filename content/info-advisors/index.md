        Everyone in the USC community is welcome to participate.  USC faculty and researchers can submit project proposals. Students can join the kick-off event at the beginning of the semester and learn more about it.

        Past DataFirst events have included participation from faculty and students from a diverse range of departments and specializations, from journalism and communications to biology and social work. Faculty and researchers get directly involved in projects, gaining exposure to the variety of opportunities at USC for data science to solve pressing real world challenges.
