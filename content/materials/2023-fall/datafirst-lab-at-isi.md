# DataFirst Hub at ISI

We offer and encourage DataFirst students to come to the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) to work on their DataFirst projects, especially

- to take advantage of a co-working space to meet and learn with other DataFirst students in person
- to attend tutorials and
- to connect with DataFirst advisors and other data science practitioners coming to the space

(But we understand that most students' academic life is centered around USC's main campus and that many students will do much of their DataFirst work there, as well as communicate on Zoom. The DataFirst Hub at ISI is an additional option we would like to offer.)
