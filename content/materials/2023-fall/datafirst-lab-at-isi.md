# DataFirst Lab at ISI

We offer and encourage DataFirst students to come to the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) to work on their DataFirst projects, especially

- to meet/work with other DataFirst students
- to attend tutorials and
- to connect with DataFirst faculty who work predominantly at ISI in person (with an appointment ahead of time)

(But we understand that most students' academic life is centered around USC's main campus and that many students will do much of their DataFirst work there, as well as communicate on Zoom. The DataFirst Lab at ISI is an additional option we would like to offer.)
