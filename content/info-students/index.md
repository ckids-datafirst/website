        Welcome to DataFirst: Empowering Data Science Education at USC
      text: |

        DataFirst is a recurring, semester-long event at USC where students from different backgrounds and programs get hands-on experience in real projects involving data science. DataFirst focuses on projects proposed by USC faculty and researchers, often combining faculty and students in data science as well as in other disciplines.

        Awards for students that demonstrate salient contributions and unique skills are given when the final DataFirst project presentations take place at the end of the semester.

      text: |
        Everyone in the USC community is welcome to participate.  USC faculty and researchers can submit project proposals. Students can join the kick-off event at the beginning of the semester and learn more about it.

        Past DataFirst events have included participation from faculty and students from a diverse range of departments and specializations, from journalism and communications to biology and social work. Students have a chance to learn how to incorporate the different aspects of data science into their academic projects.
