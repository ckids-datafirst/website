&lt;p>Lots of personal data can be obtained from wearable devices such as smart watches. This data can be used to improve health, for example to learn to detect health problems and to check whether people adhere to doctor’s exercise recommendations. This project will conduct a thorough study of the ethical issues in using AI systems in this domain, with recommendations of how AI systems for smart health should be designed with ethical considerations in mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Highly accurate fault detection in foundry produced microelectronics is crucial to ensuring quality of devices that leave the foundry. However, current defect detection flows are human-centric, which produces a bottleneck. The objective of this project is to leverage recent advances in AI/ML to develop automated techniques that can 1) identify manufacturing defects in microelectronics using imagery collected at the foundry, and 2) determine whether the identified defect will impact the performance of the manufactured component.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Public sector institutions at local, state, and federal levels are facing an unprecedented hiring crisis in competition for new talent. Yet there is no systematic understanding of the needs and openings across these levels of government to inform stakeholders such as universities, community colleges, and high schools on the current and emerging hiring trends in what constitutes approximately 15-20% of the entire labor market. In this project, students will develop algorithms that continuously scrap relevant job sites used by these governments to assess both developed and emerging hiring trends by aptitudes, professions, entry-levels, mobility, location, and other important attributes. In so doing, the project will inform researchers in public policy, public administration, political science, and labor economics as well as practitioners in government and associated stakeholders.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Question type coding is used in research on forensic interviewing to distinguish between best practice open-ended questions, and closed-ended and leading questions that interviewers are trained to avoid. Most research teams in the field rely on a time-consuming and labor-intensive method of question type coding whereby a researcher codes every question in the interview, and a second researcher codes a subset to demonstrate inter-rater reliability. We are currently working with a graduate of the Masters in Computer Science program at USC on a project exploring automated question type coding of forensic interviews with victims of child abuse. In collaboration with the student, we have trained a large language model (RoBERTa) to distinguish between question types based on a rudimentary classification system. In the next stage of the project, we are aiming to finetune the model and use zero shot and few shot prompting to make distinctions for which there is limited manually-coded data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prototype an approach to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to help diagnose areas to improve a specific writing product. For example, scientific papers require consistent language but in creative writing variety matters. Proposed steps are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Writing Product: Coordinate with project mentors to choose a common and important writing product, such as a position paper or an academic conference. Identify/gather a rubric and a corpus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inject Bad Writing: For each element of the rubric, develop prompts for generative AI to decrease the quality of writing based on the rubric (i.e., make it worse). This will form a training data set of the good example and version worse on certain characteristics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fine Tune: Students will be expected to attempt to fine tune an LLM (e.g., LLAMA 2) based on this synthetically generated data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluate: Research if tuning suggests better domain-specific areas to improve.&lt;/li>

This project will build a general-purpose analysis platform and dashboard, similar to what many teams use internally. Using the nflfastr data, this platform will allow interested individuals to select the play parameters they're interested in, and will provide relevant analysis, visualization and insight.

&lt;p>Broadband networks owned and/or operated by local governments (&amp;quot;muni networks&amp;quot;) are increasingly seen as a key tool to close the digital divide in Internet availability and adoption. There is however only anecdotal evidence about whether muni networks deliver on the promise of more affordable broadband in communities of little interest to traditional ISPs - typically disadvantaged communities. Taking advantage of the greater level of resolution in the new FCC broadband availability maps, this project will examine broadband pricing and adoption at the address level in areas served by muni networks, using a matched sample of comparable areas as a reference point. The goal of the project is to empirically assert whether muni networks are delivering on the promise of more affordable services, and whether this results in more household adoption than expected. The project is a component of an ongoing collaboration with digital equity advocacy organizations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Federated learning is an approach to distributed deep learning without sharing data. Multiple site train a neural network over private data. The parameters of the neural network are shared with a federation controller, but they are encrypted before sharing. Model aggregation is performed under fully homomorphic encryption. We propose to apply federated learning to several problems in neuroscience, such as predicting Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, and autism, possibly over multimodal data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When it comes to classification tasks, many previous work has tried to design larger and more complex neural networks. Recently, the line of data-centric AI has worked on shifting the focus to the quality of the train data. This shift arises from the recognition that the annotations associated with dataset instances can exhibit both noise, stemming from vague instructions or human errors, and bias, arising from differing perspectives among annotators in response to given prompts.
In this project, our objective is to bridge the gap between the two lines of research: one dedicated to identifying noisy instances and the other striving to account for the diverse perspectives of annotators. Specifically, we will delve into the domain of offensive text detection datasets, a highly subjective task. Our investigation will center on whether perspectivist classification models have effectively harnessed valuable information from instances flagged as noisy by noise-detection techniques.&lt;/p>

Students working on this project will work with all faculty at Price and Marshall to catalogue the publicly available, restricted-use, and self-collected datasets that USC researchers have previously used. They will then create a secure website to track each data source and its data use agreements, dates of availability, and geographic level of granularity.

&lt;p>Developing image-based object detection and classification models requires significant time, resources, and effort. Especially, acquiring a good training dataset is essential. However, there are some cases when it is very hard to get quality data such as rare cases (e.g., disasters) or expensive cases to get (e.g., faraway places). Due to the development of generative AI, we might produce synthetic images to enhance the quality of dataset by filling up missing images with them. Based on our prior work in object detection and classification for smart city applications, we would like to explore the potential of AI generated images for an enhanced object detection and classification.&lt;/p>
